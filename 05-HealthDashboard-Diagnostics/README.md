## üé® Health Check States

The application demonstrates three health states:

### ‚úÖ Healthy
- All systems operating normally
- Response times within acceptable limits
- No errors or issues detected

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Degraded
- System is functional but experiencing issues
- High latency or performance problems
- Non-critical errors that don't prevent operation

### ‚ùå Unhealthy
- System is not functioning properly
- Critical errors or failures
- Service unavailable or unresponsive

## üîß Configuration

### Health Check Settings

Health checks can be configured in `Program.cs`. See `Examples/CustomHealthCheckRegistration.cs` for comprehensive examples:

```csharp
// External API timeout
new ExternalApiHealthCheck(httpClient, logger, "https://api.example.com", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))

// File system minimum free space (50MB)
new FileSystemHealthCheck(logger, "/path/to/monitor", 1024 * 1024 * 50)

// Memory usage limit (512MB)
new MemoryHealthCheck(logger, 1024 * 1024 * 512)

// Redis cache with timeout
new RedisHealthCheck(logger, "localhost:6379", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5))

// SQL Server with custom query
new SqlConnectionHealthCheck(logger, connectionString, "SELECT 1", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30))

// Message queue with depth monitoring
new MessageQueueHealthCheck(logger, "orders-queue", connectionString, maxQueueDepth: 1000)
```

### Configuration from appsettings.json

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=MyApp;Trusted_Connection=true;",
    "Redis": "localhost:6379",
    "MessageQueue": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
  },
  "HealthChecks": {
    "Redis": {
      "Timeout": "00:00:05",
      "Enabled": true
    },
    "SqlServer": {
      "TestQuery": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users",
      "Timeout": "00:00:30",
      "Enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Health Check Tags

Tags are used to categorize and filter health checks:

```csharp
.AddCheck<CustomHealthCheck>("my-check", tags: new[] { "custom", "business" })
```

## üìà Monitoring Integration

This implementation is designed to integrate with monitoring systems:

### Container Orchestration
- `/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe

### Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus metrics can be added to health checks
- JSON endpoints for integration with monitoring dashboards
- Structured logging for centralized log analysis

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Health check data includes timing information
- Exception details for troubleshooting
- Custom data fields for business metrics

## üß™ Simulated Scenarios

The business service health checks simulate realistic scenarios:

1. **Random Latency:** Services exhibit varying response times
2. **Intermittent Failures:** Occasional unhealthy states
3. **Performance Degradation:** High latency conditions
4. **Recovery Patterns:** Services that recover over time

## üîß Additional Custom Health Check Examples

The project includes several additional custom health check examples to demonstrate different patterns:

### Redis Health Check (`RedisHealthCheck.cs`)
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates cache service monitoring
- **Features:**
  - Connection timeout handling
  - Latency monitoring with thresholds
  - Sensitive data masking in connection strings
  - Simulated cache metrics (hit ratio, memory usage)
- **Usage Example:**
  ```csharp
  services.AddHealthChecks()
      .AddCheck<RedisHealthCheck>("redis-cache", 
          tags: new[] { "cache", "external" });
  ```

### SQL Connection Health Check (`SqlConnectionHealthCheck.cs`)
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates database connectivity monitoring
- **Features:**
  - Custom test query execution
  - Connection and query timing
  - Database performance metrics
  - Connection string security (password masking)
  - Timeout and error handling
- **Usage Example:**
  ```csharp
  services.AddHealthChecks()
      .AddCheck<SqlConnectionHealthCheck>("sql-database", 
          tags: new[] { "database", "critical" });
  ```

### Message Queue Health Check (`MessageQueueHealthCheck.cs`)
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates message queue system monitoring
- **Features:**
  - Queue depth monitoring with thresholds
  - Dead letter queue tracking
  - Consumer count verification

### Debugging Health Checks

1. **Enable detailed logging:**
   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks": "Debug"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check individual health checks:**
   ```bash
   curl https://localhost:5001/api/health/category/external
   ```

3. **Monitor dashboard for real-time status:**
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect API calls
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify network requests to health endpoints

4. **Test health checks programmatically:**
   - See `Examples/HealthCheckTestingExamples.cs` for testing patterns
   - Use the provided test runner to validate health check behavior
   - Test different scenarios including timeouts and cancellation

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Custom Health Checks

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Implement IHealthCheck Interface:**
   ```csharp
   public class MyCustomHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
   {
       private readonly ILogger<MyCustomHealthCheck> _logger;
       
       public MyCustomHealthCheck(ILogger<MyCustomHealthCheck> logger)
       {
           _logger = logger;
       }
       
       public async Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(
           HealthCheckContext context, 
           CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
       {
           try
           {
               // Your health check logic here
               var isHealthy = await CheckServiceAsync();
               
               var data = new Dictionary<string, object>
               {
                   ["check_time"] = DateTime.UtcNow,
                   ["service_version"] = "1.0.0"
               };
               
               return isHealthy 
                   ? HealthCheckResult.Healthy("Service is running", data)
                   : HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy("Service is down", data: data);
           }
           catch (Exception ex)
           {
               return HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy($"Health check failed: {ex.Message}", ex);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Register in Program.cs:**
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
       .AddCheck<MyCustomHealthCheck>("my-service", 
           tags: new[] { "custom", "business" });
   ```

3. **Add Dependencies (if needed):**
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddSingleton<MyCustomHealthCheck>(provider =>
       new MyCustomHealthCheck(
           provider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<MyCustomHealthCheck>>(),
           "custom-parameter"));
   ```

### Health Check Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Return Types:**
   - `Healthy`: Service is fully operational
   - `Degraded`: Service has issues but is still functional
   - `Unhealthy`: Service is not working properly

2. **Include Useful Data:**
   - Response times
   - Resource usage
   - Configuration values (masked if sensitive)
   - Timestamps

3. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:**
   - Always wrap in try-catch
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Return meaningful error messages

4. **Use Cancellation Tokens:**
   - Respect cancellation requests
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Handle OperationCanceledException

5. **Tag Your Health Checks:**
   - Use tags for categorization
   - Enable filtering by category
   - Support different probe types (readiness, liveness)
